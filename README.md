## VMovies
A movie site with the IMDB database. Personal project developed with inspiration from movie and streaming sites. Made essentially with the aim of getting used to the use of MaterialUI and separate resources such as, for example, the consumption of API, Routes, Zustand as a state manager, among others.
<br/><br/>

## Features
- Showcase Container which highlights the trending movie of the day at the top of the page
- Movie Search
- Movie Sections are available on the homepage and can be viewed completely in the category route
- Movie Details are the pages which provide details about the film such as the overview, movie duration, cast and crew...
- Similar Movies

## What I've learned
This is one of my first major projects, which took longer than usual to produce, but that was because I didn't plan very well. In the middle of the development I realized that I should have planned it better so that I could make better use of my time and have my goals with the project clearer. Using some new technologies and techniques such as MaterialUI and Zustand contributed a little to the long development time, but they added a lot to my overall development experience
<br/><br/>
## How can i see it
The project was deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), you can check the page on [VMovies](https://vmovies-volpatocode.vercel.app) or u can just download/fork here, install the dependencies by typing "npm install" and run it with "npm run dev". The project is fully responsive, which means you can view it on the device of your choice.
